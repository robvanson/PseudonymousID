# PseudonymousID
Create a Pseudonymous ID based on a personal ID number and a combination of the Initials and the year of birth (Initials+YoB).

## When to use Pseudonymous IDs?

When identities in a large data set, or streamed data, contains names and identities that must be recoded into unique pseudonymous IDs on the fly, or in parallel, while the identities and their "names" are unknown beforehand, it can be advantageous to recode each name/identity to a pseudonymous hash. Every occurence of a name/identity can then be recoded without the need for a large name/identity list.
